# Green Grocery Store Database Project
## Project Description

This project involves the creation of a database in both Oracle and T-SQL environments, with specific components outlined below:

### Oracle Database

- **Triggers**: Implementation of 6 triggers, encompassing both before and after events for insert, delete, and update operations. Triggers exhibit diverse effects, including data modification, record insertion, retrieval of information via group functions, value replacement, and record deletion. Utilization of row triggers, table triggers, and cursors is incorporated.

- **Procedures**: Development of 3 procedures, with at least one utilizing cursors and one handling exceptions.

### T-SQL Database

- **Triggers**: Construction of 6 triggers with a minimum of 3 involving cursors. Triggers leverage system tables, including inserted and deleted records, to ensure consistency with the Oracle database triggers.

- **Procedures**: Creation of 3 procedures, each representing a distinct type, including result set, output, and return.

The objective is to ensure that the triggers and procedures implemented in the T-SQL database facilitate the same functionalities and results as those in the Oracle database.
